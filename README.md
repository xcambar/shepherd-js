## What is shepherd ?

Shepherd is a module loader and dependency manager for your JS apps, that takes a radically different approach than similar projects, and can effectively port your JS code to both-side (client- AND server-side)

Shepherd is like no other module loader in many ways, including:

* it is compatible with AMD AND CommonJS
* it has a non-obstrusive lightweight syntax compliant with the upcoming specifications from ECMA (named ECMAScript:harmony-modules)
* it allows developers to secure external libraries by litteraly turning them into modules and avoid global pollution!
* It helps turning your legacy code into module in seconds (literally!)
* Your code remains compatible with non-shepherd'ed applications. It' 100% backward compatible. Migrate your apps with ease!

## Usage

A complete set of instruction on the syntax to be used will be added soon.

Meanwhile, you can visit the pointers located in the header of shepherd.js as references.

Examples are also available to help get started.

## Enjoy!
