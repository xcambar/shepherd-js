# Shepherd

## What is it ?

__Shepherd__ is a polyfill for the new module syntax coming in ECMAScript:Harmony.

Shepherd enables the Harmony modules syntax in engines that don't support it yet.
ES:Harmony:modules compatible files can not be parsed on non ES6-enabled engines, unless using a polyfill such as Shepherd.

## Quick features list

__Shepherd__:

* is cross-side, which means it works well in the browser and in the server
* has a ECMAScript Harmony compatible syntax
* Ennables files/libraries you can not modify (eg, jQuery from a CDN) to be declared as modules
* Provides an optimizer + minifier (using [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) for production
