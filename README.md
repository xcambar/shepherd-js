# Shepherd

Your Web application is a valley.

Each of your JS files is a field in this valley in which lie sheep (prototypes, functions, variables, instances, ...).

Wouldn't you be much happier if your sheep kept grazing in their own dedicated field, instead of freely moving in that whole valley of yours?

Wouldn't you be more confident if only you could choose which sheep can visit which field ?

Wouldn't you like it if you could still enjoy the beauty of your fields and the valley by avoiding the installation of fences ?

Probably you would.

If so, then it's time to hire a __Shepherd__ for your JS files and applications.

## What is it ?

__Shepherd__ is three-fold:

* a module loader
* a dependency manager
* a _modulerizer_ (couldn't find any better word...) for your JS files and apps.

## Quick features list

__Shepherd__:

* is cross-side, which means it works well in the browser and in the server
* has a ECMAScript Harmony compatible syntax
* is non-destructive to your files. Your javascript will work even without Shepherd, but they'll work better with it!
* requires near-zero time to update your code (think of "use strict"; it works just the same!)
* Works even with files/libraries you can not modify (eg, jQuery from a CDN)

## Want more ?

You may want to check out the [home page](http://xcambar.github.com/shepherd-js) (which indeed uses Shepherd itself) or maybe even the [tests](http://xcambar.github.com/shepherd-js/vendor/shepherd/test/).

# Enjoy!

Have fun with __Shepherd__! Once it is in use, take a chair and enjoy the view, your valley is really gorgeous!
